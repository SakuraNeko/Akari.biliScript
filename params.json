The helper provides, by design, seekability and the ability to fit its display regardless of player settings (as far as $.root remains accessible).\r\n\r\nAkari.biliScript was originally written for Round and Round under the temporary name of \"Comment Art Helper for submission Round and Round\". It was renamed \"Akari.biliScript\" some time after the submission was made public.\r\n\r\nFor more information please view the repository on GitHub.\r\n\r\nGetting\r\n-------\r\n\r\nDownload the repository above and use the provided Akari.biliScript. If you are into customizing, remove the namespaces you don't need (add ones you need), and drag Akari.Template.biliScript onto BiliScript.AkariBuilder.exe. You will get a Akari.biliScript whose contents you can just copy and post to 0:0. Currently you will have to have .net Framework 4.5 on your computer to run the executable (since it was originally just a tiny utility for myself).\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nAkari.biliScript is licensed under [GNU GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/).\r\n","name":"Akari.biliscript","tagline":"Akari.biliScript is an open source (also by nature of player scripts) helper for authoring Comment Arts in BiliPlayer, the comment player for bilibili.tv, with its distinctive mode-8 scripting capability."}
